<p>This is an e-Learning Community, which enables its members to learn from each other.</p>

<p>Generally, just like other social network platforms, this community highly depends on its members to contribute contents -- learning materials, methods, experiences, and comments. It is totally different from a traditional, centralized learning platform, where the study experiences are organized by people who runs the web site.</p>

<p>Due to variety of human intelligences, learning process is personalized, which renders standardized study approach less efficient. That is a rationale behind the idea of building a decentralized platform to provide diversified learning experiences.</p>

<p>The above proposition is based on a strong belief: the evolution of World Wide Web, especially web 2.0 concept, laid a foundation to equalize learning opportunities. Now, what e-learning can offer should be more than just convenience, efficiency, and low cost. With peer-assisted collaborative learning model, this community hope to facilitate people to learn from each other, regardless of their social, economical, academical or geographical status.</p>

<p>Also, this Community differentiates itself to other remote education websites in several other ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a free community, where people can study whatever subject without paying money for it.</li>
<li>It's an open source project (applies LGPL 3.0 License).</li>
<li>No ads or commercials in user interface.</li>
</ul>
